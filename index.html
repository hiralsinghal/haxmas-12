                    <p>
                        I am a 16 year old who likes to do many things.
                        I love reading. F1 is my favourite sport and the only sport that I watch.
                        I enjoy listening music.
                        I even write sometimes.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Formula 1</h2>
                    <p>
                        Formula 1 is the pinnacle of motorsports. It first began in 1950. Since then many different drivers have gone on to win the World Drivers Championship.
                        Currently, there are 10 teams and 20 drivers on the grid. This year's WDC has been won by Lando Norris, a McLaren driver. Coming in second was Max Verstappen, driver for the Red Bull team.
